# Day 9 – Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)

**Date:** 2025-09-05  

## What I Learned
- How the **Euclidean Algorithm** works to find GCD efficiently  
- Difference between **iterative** and **recursive** approaches  
- Practical uses of GCD in number theory and cryptography  

## Tasks Completed
- Implemented GCD with while-loop (iterative)  
- Implemented GCD with recursion  
- Tested with multiple number pairs  

## Files
- `day9_gcd.js` → Euclidean algorithm for GCD
