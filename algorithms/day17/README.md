# Day 17 – Prime Factorization with Exponents

**Date:** 2025-09-12  

## What I Learned
- Improved **prime factorization algorithm**.  
- How to store factors with their **exponents** using objects.  
- Formatting results into a clean mathematical expression.  

## Tasks Completed
- Implemented a function to break down numbers into prime factors.  
- Added logic to count exponent powers of each prime.  
- Displayed the factorization in a neat format (e.g., `120 = 2^3 × 3 × 5`).  

## Files
