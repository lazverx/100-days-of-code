# Day 20 – Dijkstra’s Algorithm (Shortest Path)

**Date:** 2025-09-16  

## What I Learned
- Representing a graph using **adjacency maps** in JavaScript.  
- Using **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** to calculate the shortest path in a weighted graph.  
- Understanding the use of **priority queue logic** to always pick the next closest node.  

## Tasks Completed
- Built a `Graph` class with `addNode`, `addEdge`, and `dijkstra` method.  
- Implemented **shortest path calculation** from a source node to all other nodes.  
- Tested with a weighted graph.  

## Files
- `dijkstra.js`
