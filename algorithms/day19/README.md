# Day 19 â€“ Matrix Determinant & Transpose

**Date:** 2025-09-15  

## What I Learned
- How to compute the **transpose** of a matrix using `map()`.  
- How to recursively calculate the **determinant** of an `n x n` matrix.  
- The role of minors and cofactors in determinant calculation.  

## Tasks Completed
- Implemented a `transpose` function for matrices.  
- Implemented a recursive `determinant` function with base cases for 1x1 and 2x2 matrices.  
- Tested with a `3x3` matrix.  

## Files
- `matrixOperations.js`
