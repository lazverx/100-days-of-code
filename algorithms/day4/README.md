# Day 4 â€“ Fibonacci Sequence

**Date:** 2025-08-31

## What I Learned
- The concept of the Fibonacci sequence.
- How to implement Fibonacci using iterative and recursive approaches.
- The trade-offs: iterative is efficient, recursive is elegant but slower for large `n`.

## Tasks Completed
- Wrote a function to generate Fibonacci sequence iteratively.
- Wrote a function to calculate Fibonacci numbers recursively.
- Tested the implementation with example inputs.

## Files
- `fibonacci.js`
