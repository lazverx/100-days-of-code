**Date:** 2025-09-04  

## What I Learned
- How to manipulate arrays using built-in methods in JavaScript  
- The difference between **mutating methods** (push, pop, shift, unshift) and **non-mutating methods** (map, filter, reduce)  
- Practiced functional programming concepts with `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`  

## Tasks Completed
- Implemented array operations with `push`, `pop`, `shift`, `unshift`  
- Created new arrays using `map` and `filter`  
- Calculated sum of array elements using `reduce`
