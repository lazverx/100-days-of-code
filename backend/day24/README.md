# Day 24 – REST API Design Basics
**Date:** 2025-09-20  

## What I Learned
- How to structure REST API routes with proper naming conventions (`/api/resource`).  
- The difference between `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE`.  
- Returning proper HTTP status codes (`201 Created`, `404 Not Found`).  

## Tasks Completed
- Created a `/api/projects` resource with full CRUD operations.  
- Implemented proper REST naming conventions.  
- Added error handling for missing projects.  

## Files
- `index.js` → Express server with REST API endpoints.
