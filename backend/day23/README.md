- Handling data in memory using arrays.  
- Using `req.params` and `req.body` to update or delete specific resources.  

## Tasks Completed
- Created Express server.  
- Implemented `/users` endpoint with POST, GET, PUT, DELETE methods.  
- Used `Date.now()` as a simple unique ID generator.  

## Files
